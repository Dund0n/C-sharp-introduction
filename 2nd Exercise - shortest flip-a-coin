1st attempt
Random coin = new();
int flip = coin.Next(1,3);
Console.WriteLine(flip == 1 ? "Flip Result: Heads" : "Flip Result: Tails");

then I remembered I could supress this useless variable by putting it between
parenthesis, like that:

Random coin = new();
Console.WriteLine((coin.Next(1,3) == 1) ? "Flip Result: Heads" : "Flip Result: Tails");
