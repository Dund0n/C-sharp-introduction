Hello! My name's Gustavo, but many people
call me Dundon. I'm new to programming but
I wanna learn C# in order to develop games
as a hobbie.

I'm only learning through exercism.com,
which is a site with various languages
courses. I also don't own a PC, this 
forces me to depend on my cellphone 
I'm documenting everything I do, every
question I have and almost all my thoughts
throughout the whole process. many of my
ideas written after double slashes "//"
which I knew from previous interactions 
that it doesn't affect the code
Feel free to get in touch with me,
although I bet anyone will ever reach this

Instagram: @guttdraw

This is my Instagram account that I post
my drawings, and it is where I'm most
active

Discord: dund0n

To be fair I rarely use discord, moist of
the times are when I'm in call with my
friends and we play together... but it's 
another way to contact me anyways

As I told, Im new to programming and to
GitHub as well, so I don't know if this 
site has any communication channel. If
I found that it has, I'll make sure to
update this README as well.
